## WATCHTOWER_TIMEOUT Configuration Implementation

In this session, we added support for the WATCHTOWER_TIMEOUT environment variable to the watchtower service configuration. This environment variable controls how long watchtower will wait for Docker API responses when checking for container updates.

### Changes Made

1. Added `watchtower_timeout` variable (default: 10s) to:
   - `services/watchtower/defaults/main.yml`
   - `services/watchtower/vars/main.example.yml`

2. Set a custom value (60s) in:
   - `services/watchtower/vars/main.yml` for production use

3. Updated the Docker Compose template:
   - Added WATCHTOWER_TIMEOUT environment variable to `services/watchtower/templates/watchtower-unified.yml.j2`
   - Used the same variable pattern as other environment variables

4. Added `.vscode/mcp.json` for Serena MCP server configuration

### Testing
- Ran the template test playbook (`test-template-playbook.yml`) to verify:
  1. Default value (10s) is used when not explicitly set
  2. Custom value (60s) overrides the default when provided
  3. Environment variable appears in the correct position in Docker Compose files

### Cleanup
- Removed temporary test files
- Committed all changes with a descriptive message

This configuration provides more flexibility in environments with slower registry responses or unstable network conditions.
