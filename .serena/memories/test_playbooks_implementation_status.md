# Test Playbooks Implementation Status

## Task Overview
Created test playbooks for ansible roles in the homelab infrastructure project, following the pattern established in existing services (drone, watchtower, drone-runner-exec, nut).

## Completed Work

### Services Implemented
1. **disk-monitoring** - ✅ Complete
2. **gitea** - ✅ Complete  
3. **gitea-act-runner** - ✅ Complete

### Files Created/Modified

#### Disk Monitoring
- ✅ Created `services/disk-monitoring/tasks/test.yml`
- ✅ Created `services/disk-monitoring/test-playbook.yml`
- ✅ Created `services/disk-monitoring/tasks/main-test.yml` (workaround for role_path issue)

#### Gitea
- ✅ Created `services/gitea/tasks/test.yml`
- ✅ Updated `services/gitea/test-playbook.yml`

#### Gitea Act Runner
- ✅ Created `services/gitea-act-runner/tasks/test.yml`
- ✅ Updated `services/gitea-act-runner/test-playbook.yml`

## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Role Path Variable Issue
- **Problem**: `role_path` variable undefined when using `include_tasks` vs proper role import
- **Solution**: Created `main-test.yml` that uses `playbook_dir` instead of `role_path`

### 2. Host Filtering by Roles
- **Problem**: Test playbooks running on all hosts, including unsuitable ones (like Synology NAS for Linux packages)
- **Solution**: Added dynamic grouping using `group_by` to filter hosts based on `host_roles` in inventory

### 3. Shell Command Escaping Issue (CURRENT ISSUE)
- **Problem**: Regex shell commands in test.yml work when run manually but fail in Ansible
- **Current Status**: User removed problematic disk plugin checks and InfluxDB output checks from test.yml
- **Commands that failed**: `grep -E "\[\[inputs\.disk\]\]|\[\[inputs\.diskio\]\]"` and similar

## Test Structure Pattern
All test playbooks follow this pattern:
1. Dynamic host grouping based on inventory `host_roles`
2. First play: Run main configuration tasks
3. Second play: Run validation tests

## Quality Checks
- ✅ All files pass pre-commit checks
- ✅ All files pass ansible-lint
- ✅ All files pass syntax validation

## Next Steps Needed
1. Fix shell command escaping in disk-monitoring plugin checks
2. Consider alternative approaches to regex matching in Ansible shell commands
3. Test all playbooks in actual environment to ensure functionality

## Test Commands Used
```bash
# Linting
ansible-lint services/*/test-playbook.yml services/*/tasks/test.yml

# Syntax check
ansible-playbook --syntax-check test-playbook.yml
```
