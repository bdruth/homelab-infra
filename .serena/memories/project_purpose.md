# Homelab Infrastructure Project

## Purpose and Goals

The homelab-infra project provides a comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution for managing homelab services. It's designed to automate the deployment and configuration of various self-hosted services using modern DevOps practices.

### Core Goals

- Maintain consistent, repeatable deployments using Ansible and Terraform/OpenTofu
- Provide high availability for critical services
- Enable CI/CD workflows within the homelab
- Monitor system health and resources
- Document and track infrastructure changes

## Problems Solved

This project addresses several key challenges in managing a home server environment:

1. **Configuration Drift**: Without Infrastructure as Code (IaC), manual server configuration leads to inconsistencies, making troubleshooting difficult and recovery time-consuming.

2. **Documentation Gap**: Homelab setups often lack proper documentation, making it difficult to reproduce configurations or understand why certain decisions were made.

3. **Service Management Complexity**: Managing multiple services across different machines requires systematic approaches to deployment, monitoring, and updates.

4. **High Availability Challenges**: Ensuring critical services remain available requires redundancy and failover mechanisms that are difficult to implement manually.

5. **Security Concerns**: Consistent security practices across all infrastructure components need systematic implementation.

## Philosophy and Principles

This project embodies several key principles:

1. **Automation First**: Any task performed more than once should be automated
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: All configuration exists as code in version control
3. **Idempotence**: Operations should be repeatable with consistent results
4. **Self-Documentation**: The code itself serves as documentation, supplemented by explicit documentation
5. **Monitoring by Default**: All services include monitoring and alerting
6. **Security in Depth**: Multiple layers of security are implemented across the infrastructure
7. **Graceful Failure**: Services should degrade gracefully when dependencies fail
8. **Local Control**: Maintain ownership and control over critical infrastructure and data

## Success Metrics

- Reliable, automated deployments
- Minimal manual intervention required for maintenance
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Well-documented infrastructure for future reference
- Easy recovery in case of system failure

## Target Environment and Scope

- Mixed environment of physical and virtual servers
- Network services for home lab use
- Potential integration with cloud services for specific functions
- Focuses on homelab infrastructure services
- Does not include application development unrelated to infrastructure
- Prioritizes automation and infrastructure stability
