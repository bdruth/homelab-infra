## Current Task Status

### Fixed Issue: Undefined docker_cmd variable in Gitea role
We identified and fixed an issue with an undefined `docker_cmd` variable in the Gitea role that was causing failures when deploying against the `synology1` host. The solution included:

1. Creating `services/gitea/defaults/main.yml` with a default value for `docker_cmd`:
```yaml
---
# Default variables for Gitea role

# Default Docker command - can be overridden in host_vars or inventory
docker_cmd: "docker"
# For Synology specifically, this will likely be overridden to /usr/local/bin/docker
# synology_docker_path: "/usr/local/bin/docker"
```

2. Adding `docker_cmd` to the host variables in `services/host_vars/synology1.yml`:
```yaml
# Docker configuration for Synology NAS
docker_cmd: "/usr/local/bin/docker"
```

3. Changes have been committed with the message "Fix undefined docker_cmd variable for gitea role"

### Current Focus
We've begun examining the NUT (Network UPS Tools) configuration. The user had opened the test tasks file at:
`/Users/bruth/Projects/homelab-infra/services/nut/tasks/test.yml`

This file contains various test tasks for verifying NUT installation and configuration including:
- Package installation checks
- Configuration file existence verification
- Service status checks
- UPS connection tests

We've also looked at the `nut-only.yml` playbook which deploys NUT UPS monitoring to hosts with 'nut' in their host_roles.

Possible next tasks may involve enhancing or troubleshooting the NUT monitoring setup.
