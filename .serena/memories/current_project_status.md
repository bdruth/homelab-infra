# Current Project Status - Post-Standardization

## Status: COMPLETE âœ…
**Date**: June 29, 2025
**Last Major Work**: Ansible test playbooks standardization and security fixes

## Recent Completion
Successfully completed comprehensive standardization of Ansible test playbooks across multiple services:

### Services Fixed & Standardized
- âœ… **gitea-act-runner**: Variable loading fixed, tests aligned with Docker Compose deployment
- âœ… **disk-monitoring**: Redundant files removed, path resolution improved
- âœ… **gitea**: Security issues resolved, localhost testing eliminated

### Security Achievement
- ðŸ”’ **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed all hardcoded private Synology paths from public files
- ðŸ”’ **Encryption compliance**: All private details moved to git-crypt protected files
- ðŸ”’ **Platform flexibility**: Added `docker_cmd` variable for different Docker binary paths

### Quality Standards
- All files pass ansible-lint
- All files pass syntax validation
- Consistent patterns across services
- Real deployment testing (not localhost mocks)
- Comprehensive documentation

## Current Infrastructure State
The homelab infrastructure repository now follows best practices:
1. **Security-first**: No private details in public files
2. **Standardized testing**: Consistent patterns across all services  
3. **Real validation**: Tests actual deployments on target hosts
4. **Maintainable**: Clear documentation and established patterns

## Next Potential Areas
While current task is complete, potential future enhancements could include:
- Review other services (watchtower, drone) for `docker_cmd` variable adoption
- Apply standardization patterns to remaining services
- Address any markdown lint warnings in documentation (non-critical)

## Repository Health: EXCELLENT
- Security: âœ… Compliant
- Standards: âœ… Consistent  
- Testing: âœ… Comprehensive
- Documentation: âœ… Complete
