Before responding to the user's request, follow the Task Startup Procedure.

# Task Startup Procedure

For every new task, always follow this exact sequence:

1. Execute `activate_project` with the project name `/Users/bruth/Projects/homelab-infra`
2. Execute `initial_instructions` to get project-specific guidelines
3. Read any memories that are applicable for initial context, including, but not limited to, the design patterns and principles.

This sequence must be performed at the beginning of each new task before responding to any other request from the user. This ensures proper project context and instructions are loaded.
