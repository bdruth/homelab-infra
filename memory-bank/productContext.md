# Product Context: Homelab Infrastructure

## Purpose & Problems Solved

This homelab infrastructure project exists to solve several key challenges in managing a personal/home server environment:

1. **Configuration Drift**: Without Infrastructure as Code (IaC), manual server configuration leads to inconsistencies, making troubleshooting difficult and recovery time-consuming.

2. **Documentation Gap**: Homelab setups often lack proper documentation, making it difficult to reproduce configurations or understand why certain decisions were made.

3. **Service Management Complexity**: Managing multiple services across different machines requires systematic approaches to deployment, monitoring, and updates.

4. **High Availability Challenges**: Ensuring critical services remain available requires redundancy and failover mechanisms that are difficult to implement manually.

5. **Security Concerns**: Consistent security practices across all infrastructure components need systematic implementation.

## Operational Model

The infrastructure operates through:

1. **Layered Deployment Architecture**:

   - Base infrastructure provisioning via Terraform/OpenTofu
   - Service configuration via Ansible roles and playbooks
   - Container orchestration for specific services
   - Monitoring and alerting systems that provide visibility

2. **Infrastructure as Code Workflow**:

   - All changes are defined in code (Ansible, Terraform)
   - Changes are version controlled in Git
   - CI/CD pipelines validate and deploy changes
   - Configuration is idempotent - the same operation produces the same result

3. **Service Ecosystem**:
   - Self-hosted Git service (Gitea) for code management
   - CI/CD pipelines (Drone) for automated testing and deployment
   - DNS management (Pi-hole, dnsdist) for network-wide ad blocking and DNS resolution
   - Monitoring solutions for system health and resource usage
   - Docker container management via Watchtower for automatic updates

## User Experience Goals

1. **Infrastructure Administrators**:

   - Deploy new services with minimal manual configuration
   - Update existing services safely and reliably
   - Recover from failures quickly using documented procedures
   - Monitor system health through comprehensive dashboards
   - Maintain security through consistent practices

2. **Service Users**:

   - Experience reliable service availability
   - Access services through consistent URLs/endpoints
   - Benefit from secure connections to all services
   - Enjoy improved network performance through optimized DNS

3. **Development Experience**:
   - Use self-hosted Git repositories with familiar workflows
   - Leverage CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
   - Access development tools and services within the home network

## Homelab Philosophy

This project embodies several key principles:

1. **Automation First**: Any task performed more than once should be automated
2. **Infrastructure as Code**: All configuration exists as code in version control
3. **Idempotence**: Operations should be repeatable with consistent results
4. **Self-Documentation**: The code itself serves as documentation, supplemented by explicit documentation
5. **Monitoring by Default**: All services include monitoring and alerting
6. **Security in Depth**: Multiple layers of security are implemented across the infrastructure
7. **Graceful Failure**: Services should degrade gracefully when dependencies fail
8. **Local Control**: Maintain ownership and control over critical infrastructure and data
