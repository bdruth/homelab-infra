## Known Issues

### Disk Monitoring

1. **Issue**: Variable naming inconsistency between configuration files

   - **Status**: Resolved
   - **Impact**: Confusion during configuration and potential errors
   - **Solution**: Standardized variable names across templates and defaults

2. **Issue**: Incompatible Telegraf parameters for mount points
   - **Status**: Resolved
   - **Impact**: Telegraf service errors when restarting
   - **Solution**: Updated configuration to use compatible parameters for the installed Telegraf version

### Watchtower

1. **Issue**: Update timing may disrupt service availability

   - **Status**: Investigating
   - **Impact**: Brief service interruptions
   - **Workaround**: Scheduling updates during low-usage periods

2. **Issue**: IPv6 networking in Docker requires host support
   - **Status**: Resolved
   - **Impact**: Services might lack IPv6 connectivity on certain hosts
   - **Solution**: Implemented conditional IPv6 network configuration based on host capabilities using `ansible_all_ipv6_addresses`

### Gitea Act Runner

1. **Issue**: Registration token handling needs improvement

   - **Status**: Under investigation
   - **Impact**: Potential security concern
   - **Workaround**: Using temporary tokens until fixed

2. **Issue**: Resource consumption may be high during intensive workflows

   - **Status**: Monitoring
   - **Impact**: Could affect host performance
   - **Workaround**: Limiting concurrent jobs

3. **Issue**: Permission errors when using `sudo` in GitHub Actions workflows
   - **Status**: Resolved
   - **Impact**: Failed workflow executions
   - **Solution**: Remove `sudo` from commands as they already run as root in the Ubuntu runner environment
   - **Note**: Affects commands like `apt update`, `apt-get install`, etc. which should be run directly

### General Infrastructure

1. **Issue**: Domain name resolution occasionally slow
   - **Status**: Investigating
   - **Impact**: Slight delay in service access
   - **Workaround**: DNS caching adjustments

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### CI/CD Strategy

- **Initial Approach**: Drone CI with exec runners only
- **Current Approach**: Hybrid approach using both Drone CI and Gitea Act Runners
- **Rationale**: Better compatibility with GitHub Actions workflows while maintaining existing Drone pipelines

### Service Deployment

- **Initial Approach**: Ad-hoc Ansible playbooks
- **Current Approach**: Standardized roles with both standalone and combined playbooks
- **Latest Refinement**: Integration of previously standalone components into the role-based structure (disk-monitoring)
- **Rationale**: Improved modularity, reusability, and consistency

### Monitoring Architecture

- **Initial Approach**: Separate, standalone monitoring implementations
- **Current Approach**: Integrated monitoring roles with standardized structure
- **Rationale**: Better maintainability, consistent deployment patterns, and simplified configuration

### Monitoring

- **Initial Approach**: Service-specific monitoring only
- **Current Approach**: Component-specific monitoring with integration paths
- **Current Goal**: Comprehensive, centralized monitoring solution
- **Rationale**: Better visibility across all infrastructure components

### DNS Management

- **Initial Approach**: Single Pi-hole instance
- **Current Approach**: High-availability Pi-hole with dnsdist
- **Rationale**: Improved reliability and performance for critical network services

### Containerization Strategy

- **Initial Approach**: Mix of containerized and non-containerized services
- **Current Approach**: Containerization where appropriate with automated updates
- **Rationale**: Improved isolation and easier updates while maintaining performance

## Learning Points & Project Evolution

### Successful Patterns

1. **Standardized Role Structure**: Consistent approach to service roles improves maintainability
2. **Test Playbooks**: Dedicated test playbooks for each role simplifies validation
3. **Template-based Configuration**: Jinja2 templates with variable overrides provides flexibility

### Abandoned Approaches

1. **Manual Container Updates**: Replaced with Watchtower for automation
2. **Direct Runner Execution**: Replaced with systemd service management for better lifecycle control
3. **Static DNS Configuration**: Replaced with dynamic, high-availability solution

### Future Direction

1. **Expand Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring across all services
2. **Enhance Automation**: Further reduce manual intervention in maintenance tasks
3. **Improve Documentation**: Better documentation for complex deployment scenarios
4. **Integration Testing**: More thorough testing of interactions between components
